## 5. Backend Design and Implementation
### 5.1. Emergency Class
The `Emergency` class represents an emergency instance with the following attributes:
- `emergency_id`: Unique identifier for the emergency.
- `type`: Emergency type (using `EmergencyType` enum).
- `severity_level`: Severity (1-10, where 1 is the most severe/highest priority).
- `location`: Location description.
- `coordinates`: Location coordinates (x, y).

The class implements comparison operators to prioritize emergencies by severity, then by ID:
```python
def __lt__(self, other):
    # Lower severity level means higher priority
    if self.severity_level == other.severity_level:
        return self.emergency_id < other.emergency_id
    return self.severity_level < other.severity_level
```

Additional methods in the Emergency class include:
```python
def __eq__(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, Emergency):
        return False
    return self.emergency_id == other.emergency_id

def __hash__(self):
    # Hash implementation allows emergency objects to be used in sets and as dictionary keys
    return hash(self.emergency_id)
```

### 5.2. Priority Queue Data Structures
#### 5.2.1. Linked List Implementation (LinkedListPriorityQueue)
Our linked list implementation uses a custom `Node` class and maintains a sorted list where the highest priority element (lowest severity) is always at the head.

**Node Implementation:**
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data  # Emergency object
        self.next = None  # Reference to next node
```

**Key Methods:**
```python
def enqueue(self, item):
    # Create a new node with the emergency data
    new_node = Node(item)
    
    # If queue is empty or new item has higher priority than head
    if self.head is None or item < self.head.data:
        new_node.next = self.head
        self.head = new_node
        self.size += 1
        return
    
    # Traverse the list to find the correct position
    current = self.head
    while current.next and item >= current.next.data:
        current = current.next
    
    # Insert the new node
    new_node.next = current.next
    current.next = new_node
    self.size += 1

def dequeue(self):
    # Remove and return the highest priority item (at head)
    if self.is_empty():
        return None
    
    item = self.head.data
    self.head = self.head.next
    self.size -= 1
    return item
```

**Time Complexity Analysis:**
- Enqueue: O(n) - Must traverse the list to find the correct position
- Dequeue: O(1) - Simply remove the head node
- Search: O(n) - May need to traverse the entire list

#### 5.2.2. Binary Tree Implementation (BinaryTreePriorityQueue)
Our binary search tree implementation uses a custom `TreeNode` class and maintains a tree where nodes are ordered by emergency priority.

**TreeNode Implementation:**
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data  # Emergency object
        self.left = None  # Left child (higher priority)
        self.right = None  # Right child (lower priority)
```

**Key Methods:**
```python
def enqueue(self, item):
    # Recursive helper function to insert a node
    def _insert(node, item):
        if node is None:
            return TreeNode(item)
        
        if item < node.data:
            node.left = _insert(node.left, item)
        else:
            node.right = _insert(node.right, item)
        return node
    
    self.root = _insert(self.root, item)
    self.size += 1

def dequeue(self):
    # Remove and return the highest priority item (leftmost node)
    if self.is_empty():
        return None
    
    # Special case: only one node
    if self.root.left is None:
        item = self.root.data
        self.root = self.root.right
        self.size -= 1
        return item
    
    # Find the leftmost node and its parent
    parent = None
    current = self.root
    while current.left:
        parent = current
        current = current.left
    
    # Get the highest priority item
    item = current.data
    
    # Connect parent to the right child of the leftmost node
    parent.left = current.right
    
    self.size -= 1
    return item
```

**Time Complexity Analysis:**
- Enqueue: O(log n) average, O(n) worst - Traverses one path from root to leaf
- Dequeue: O(log n) average, O(n) worst - Must find the leftmost node
- Search: O(log n) average, O(n) worst - Binary search property

#### 5.2.3. Heap Implementation (HeapPriorityQueue)
Our heap implementation uses a min-heap structure with an array representation, ensuring the highest priority element is always at the root.

**Key Implementation Details:**
```python
def __init__(self, max_size=1000):
    self.max_size = max_size
    self.heap = [None]  # Index 0 not used, start from index 1
    self.count = 0  # Current number of elements
    self.id_to_index = {}  # Maps emergency_id to heap index for O(1) lookup
```

**Key Methods:**
```python
def enqueue(self, item):
    # Add new item to the end of the heap
    self.count += 1
    if len(self.heap) <= self.count:
        self.heap.append(item)
    else:
        self.heap[self.count] = item
    
    # Update ID to index mapping
    self.id_to_index[item.emergency_id] = self.count
    
    # Restore heap property by "bubbling up"
    self._shift_up(self.count)

def dequeue(self):
    if self.is_empty():
        return None
    
    # Save the highest priority item (root)
    highest_priority_item = self.heap[1]
    del self.id_to_index[highest_priority_item.emergency_id]
    
    # Move the last element to the root
    self.heap[1] = self.heap[self.count]
    self.id_to_index[self.heap[1].emergency_id] = 1
    
    # Reduce heap size
    self.count -= 1
    
    # Restore heap property by "sifting down"
    if self.count > 0:
        self._shift_down(1)
    
    return highest_priority_item
```

**Heap Property Maintenance:**
```python
def _shift_up(self, index):
    # "Bubble up" operation to maintain heap property
    if index > 1:
        parent = index // 2
        if self._is_higher_priority(index, parent):
            self._swap(index, parent)
            self._shift_up(parent)

def _shift_down(self, index):
    # "Sift down" operation to maintain heap property
    if index <= self.count:
        left = 2 * index
        right = 2 * index + 1
        smallest = index
        
        if left <= self.count and self._is_higher_priority(left, smallest):
            smallest = left
        
        if right <= self.count and self._is_higher_priority(right, smallest):
            smallest = right
        
        if smallest != index:
            self._swap(index, smallest)
            self._shift_down(smallest)
```

**Time Complexity Analysis:**
- Enqueue: O(log n) - Single path from leaf to root
- Dequeue: O(log n) - Single path from root to leaf
- Search: O(1) - Direct lookup using id_to_index dictionary

### 5.3. Complexity Analysis
#### 5.3.1. Time Complexity
| Operation | Linked List | Binary Tree | Heap     |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Enqueue   | O(n)        | O(log n)    | O(log n) |
| Dequeue   | O(1)        | O(log n)    | O(log n) |
| Search    | O(n)        | O(n)        | O(1)     |

#### 5.3.2. Space Complexity
| Data Structure | Space Complexity | Implementation Notes |
|----------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Linked List    | O(n)             | Each node requires additional pointer overhead |
| Binary Tree    | O(n)             | Each node requires two child pointers |
| Heap           | O(n)             | Array-based implementation with additional mapping dictionary |

Our measurements using the pympler library confirm these theoretical complexities, with some interesting observations:
- The linked list structure shows consistent memory usage regardless of the number of elements
- The binary tree's memory growth tapers off as the tree size increases
- The heap structure shows the most linear relationship between memory usage and data size

### 5.4. Design Rationale and Reflections on Optimization
In developing this project, we gave special consideration to how we used our data structures and the overall efficiency of the system.

#### 5.4.1. Our Current Design and Its Justification
In the current implementation, we decided to maintain three separate instances of our priority queues (`LinkedList`, `BinarySearchTree`, and `Min-Heap`) simultaneously.

**Our Rationale**:
- This decision was made primarily for **comparative purposes**. We wanted to build a system where a user could easily switch between different views and observe, in real-time, how each data structure behaves with the exact same dataset.
- 
- **Acknowledged Trade-offs**:
- - **Data Redundancy**: Every emergency object is stored three times, tripling the memory footprint.
- - **Performance Overhead**: Write operations are less efficient, as they must be executed three times.

#### 5.4.2. Reflections on Future Optimizations
If we were to refactor this project for a real-world production environment, we would implement a more efficient design.

1.  **A Single Source of Truth**: Use a hash map (a Python dictionary) for `O(1)` average time complexity lookups by `emergency_id`.
2.  **On-Demand Instantiation**: Dynamically create the active priority queue from the hash map only when needed.
3.  **Balanced BST**: Implement a self-balancing binary search tree (like AVL or Red-Black) to guarantee O(log n) operations.
4.  **Rebuilding on Switch**: If the user switches views, dynamically build the new queue from the hash map.

This optimized design would eliminate data redundancy and restore the efficiency of write operations.

## 11. Conclusion
This City Emergency Response Management System successfully provides an effective solution for emergency management by implementing and comparing three distinct priority queue data structures. The system demonstrates the practical application of computer science principles, particularly in the areas of data structures and algorithms.

Through our implementation, we've clearly shown how different data structures impact system performance in varying scenarios. For operations requiring frequent insertions with static retrievals, the heap implementation proves most efficient. For applications requiring minimal memory overhead with fast retrievals, the linked list offers advantages. The binary tree represents a balanced approach suitable for a wide range of emergency management scenarios.

The system's combination of an intuitive visual interface and powerful analysis tools helps demonstrate key computer science concepts and offers a practical framework for optimizing emergency response. Our detailed time and space complexity analysis provides both theoretical and empirical evidence of each data structure's performance characteristics, making this project both an educational tool and a practical emergency management solution.
