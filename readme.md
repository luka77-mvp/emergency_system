    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib numpy pandas tk
    ```
2.  **Run the main program**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## 4. Backend Design
### 4.1. Emergency Class
The `Emergency` class represents an emergency instance with the following attributes:
- `emergency_id`: Unique identifier for the emergency.
- `type`: Emergency type (using `EmergencyType` enum).
- `severity_level`: Severity (1-10, where 1 is the most severe/highest priority).
- `location`: Location description.
- `coordinates`: Location coordinates (x, y).

The class implements comparison operators to prioritize emergencies by severity, then by ID:
```python
def __lt__(self, other):
    if self.severity_level == other.severity_level:
        return self.emergency_id < other.emergency_id
    return self.severity_level < other.severity_level
```

### 4.2. Priority Queue Data Structures
#### 4.2.1. Linked List Implementation (LinkedListPriorityQueue)
- **Design**: Uses a sorted linked list, with the highest priority element at the head.
- **Features**: Insertion requires traversal to find the correct position (O(n)), while deletion only requires removing the head (O(1)).

#### 4.2.2. Binary Tree Implementation (BinaryTreePriorityQueue)
- **Design**: Uses a binary search tree where nodes are sorted by emergency priority.
- **Features**: Offers average O(log n) time for insertions and deletions, and supports in-order traversal for a sorted list.

#### 4.2.3. Heap Implementation (HeapPriorityQueue)
- **Design**: Uses a min-heap, ensuring the highest priority element is always at the root.
- **Features**: Provides O(log n) time for insertions and deletions. An additional dictionary maps IDs to heap indices for fast O(1) lookups.

### 4.3. Complexity Analysis
#### 4.3.1. Time Complexity
| Operation | Linked List | Binary Tree | Heap     |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Enqueue   | O(n)        | O(log n)    | O(log n) |
| Dequeue   | O(1)        | O(log n)    | O(log n) |
| Search    | O(n)        | O(n)        | O(1)     |

#### 4.3.2. Space Complexity
| Data Structure | Space Complexity |
|----------------|------------------|
| Linked List    | O(n)             |
| Binary Tree    | O(n)             |
| Heap           | O(n)             |

### 4.4. Design Rationale and Reflections on Optimization
In developing this project, we gave special consideration to how we used our data structures and the overall efficiency of the system.

#### 4.4.1. Our Current Design and Its Justification
In the current implementation, we decided to maintain three separate instances of our priority queues (`LinkedList`, `BinarySearchTree`, and `Min-Heap`) simultaneously.

**Our Rationale**:
This decision was made primarily for **comparative purposes**. We wanted to build a system where a user could easily switch between different views and observe, in real-time, how each data structure behaves with the exact same dataset.

#### 4.4.2. Reflections on Future Optimizations
If we were to refactor this project for a real-world production environment, we would implement a more efficient design.

1.  **A Single Source of Truth**: Use a Python dictionary for `O(1)` average time complexity lookups by `emergency_id`.
2.  **On-Demand Instantiation**: Dynamically create the active priority queue from the hash map only when needed.
3.  **Rebuilding on Switch**: If the user switches views, dynamically build the new queue from the hash map.

This optimized design would eliminate data redundancy and restore the efficiency of write operations.

## 5. Testing and Coverage
### 5.1. Testing Framework
The project uses Python's built-in `unittest` framework for all unit tests.
